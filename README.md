## Founder‚Äôs Note

The internet gave us a way to find people who live hundreds, even thousands of miles away ‚Äî all with just a few clicks.
It gave everyone the chance to create a presence, a space, an identity. To design and refine it. To make it their own. To give it personality. To add little bits that make it feel like home.

Stumbling into these spaces, exploring them, breaking them down, reading what the writer has to say ‚Äî that‚Äôs where I get my fair share of daily dopamine.

So... why should everyone have one?

The real question is, *why not?*

You can do whatever you want with it. Add whatever you like ‚Äî without constraints, without restrictions.
Build something you may never get to have in real life. Or just make something simple ‚Äî something that‚Äôs good enough to tell the tiny bits that make you *you*. Share stories, memories, scattered thoughts, and little moments.

If you‚Äôve ever wanted to do that, but didn‚Äôt know where to start‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm building **Minispace** for you.

With Minispace, you can carve out your own little corner of the web.
