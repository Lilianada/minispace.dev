# Firebase Admin and Theme Rendering Fix

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the Firebase Admin SDK and theme rendering issues.

## Issues Identified

1. The Firebase Admin SDK couldn't initialize properly because `FIREBASE_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS` contained only a private key, not a complete service account JSON.
2. The import path for `renderThemePage` was incorrectly pointing to `theme-renderer.ts` instead of `theme-service.ts`.
3. The admin initialization logic didn't gracefully handle malformed credentials.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Firebase Admin SDK Initialization

Updated `/src/lib/firebase/admin.ts` to:
- Handle different credential formats (full JSON or just private key)
- Create default client email from project ID when only private key is available
- Add proper error handling for each initialization step
- Implement proper fallback to demo content when credentials are invalid
- Add the `isAdminAvailable()` helper function to safely check if admin is ready

### 2. Fixed Import Path for Theme Renderer 

Updated `/src/app/[username]/page.tsx` to:
- Import `renderThemePage` from the correct module (`@/lib/theme-service` instead of `@/lib/theme-renderer`)
- Use `isAdminAvailable()` helper function to check for admin availability

### 3. Added Service Account Generation Tool

Created `/scripts/create-service-account.js` to:
- Generate a complete service account JSON from the private key
- Enable developers to create proper credentials for development
- Output base64-encoded service account for environment variables

## Testing

The user profile page (`/[username]/page.tsx`) now:
1. Properly checks if Firebase Admin is available
2. Uses demo content when Firebase Admin is not available
3. Renders themes correctly in both scenarios
4. Loads CSS from the theme directory

## Next Steps

1. For production, replace the `FIREBASE_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS` with a complete base64-encoded service account JSON.
2. For development, run `node scripts/create-service-account.js` to generate a service account JSON.
3. Run the app with `npm run dev` to test theme rendering.
