# Founder’s Note

The internet gave us a way to find people who live hundreds, even thousands of miles away — all with just a few clicks.
It gave everyone the chance to create a presence, a space, an identity. To design and refine it. To make it their own. To give it personality. To add little bits that make it feel like home.

Stumbling into these spaces, exploring them, breaking them down, reading what the writer has to say — that’s where I get my fair share of daily dopamine.

So... why should everyone have one?

The real question is, *why not?*

You can do whatever you want with it. Add whatever you like — without constraints, without restrictions.
Build something you may never get to have in real life. Or just make something simple — something that’s good enough to tell the tiny bits that make you *you*. Share stories, memories, scattered thoughts, and little moments.

If you’ve ever wanted to do that, but didn’t know where to start…
I’m building **Minispace** for you.

With Minispace, you can carve out your own little corner of the web.

That’s a beautiful piece of sentiment — and it can serve as the **emotional foundation** for the design direction of Minispace.

Let’s distill all that you’ve said and shape a **clear, cohesive design direction** that reflects the *soul* of the product, and finally gives Minispace its own **personality**:

## 🎨 **Minispace Design Direction: “Your Little Webroom”**

### ✨ Conceptual Identity:

Minispace is *your mini corner of the web* — a place where you *collect*, *create*, *express*, and *share* the fragments that make you *you*. It is **personal**, **quiet**, **human**, and **free**.

Minispace isn’t just a blog platform.
It’s like a **digital bedroom wall**, a **scrapbook**, a **studio desk**, or a **cozy reading nook** — but online. It gives structure to self-expression without diluting its freedom.

## 🧠 **Core Themes to Reflect in Design**

| Emotion/Idea         | Expression in UI                                                     |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Personality*        | Customizable themes, quirky microinteractions, user-picked colorways |
| *Freedom*            | Unopinionated layouts, flexible content types, markdown freedom      |
| *Simplicity*         | Clean UI, minimal distractions, calm typography                      |
| *Cozy & Private*     | Soft edges, readable fonts, muted backgrounds, thoughtful spacing    |
| *Exploration*        | Navigable archives, discovery pages, “peek inside” feel              |
| *Digital permanence* | Emphasis on “owning” your space (subdomain, export options)          |

## 🪄 Visual & UI Direction

### 1. **Typography**

* Use fonts that feel like **journals** or **typewriters** (e.g., *Inter*, *IBM Plex Serif*, *Literata*, *Public Sans*)
* Large titles, comfy body size, great for long reads
* Slight imperfections welcome (e.g., small letter spacing or weight contrast)

### 2. **Colors**

* Offer **themes** that reflect moods: e.g. “Night Writer,” “Warm Desk,” “Typewriter,” “Retro Web,” “Modern Zine”
* Use **calm, non-neon palettes** by default (minimalist but expressive)
* Encourage **theme customization** (users shape their identity visually)

### 3. **Layout**

* Vertical flow: No unnecessary sidebars unless content calls for it
* Clear information hierarchy with collapsible or clean inline elements
* Every page should feel like a **blank notebook page with just the right margins**

### 4. **Tone**

* Use warm, conversational copy
* Example:

  > “This space is yours.”
  > “Write what matters to you.”
  > “Not sure where to begin? Just say hi.”

## 🌐 Minispace as a Brand

Think of Minispace as:

| It is...                    | It is not...                  |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| A warm room on the internet | A cold CMS tool               |
| A writer’s sanctuary        | A social media clone          |
| A digital zine-maker        | A polished corporate platform |
| A creative scratchpad       | A rigid templating engine     |

---

## 🌱 Why Everyone Should Have One

> Because **expression matters**.
> Because some things deserve to live outside social feeds.
> Because you never know who’ll stumble across it and stay.
> Because tiny spaces tell big stories.
