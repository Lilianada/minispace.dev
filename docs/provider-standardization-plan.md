# Provider Standardization Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for standardizing providers in the Minispace.dev project to improve architectural consistency.

## Current Status

- Created centralized `Providers` component in `/components/common/Providers.tsx`
- Updated root layout to use the standardized providers
- Documented provider structure in `/docs/provider-structure.md`
- Fixed `useAuth` hook to properly use the AuthContext

## Remaining Tasks

### Phase 1: Provider Cleanup

- [ ] Remove redundant import statements for AuthProvider
- [ ] Ensure all components are using the proper hooks for accessing context
- [ ] Validate that no components are directly importing context providers

### Phase 2: Toast System Consolidation

- [ ] Choose one toast system (recommended: Shadcn UI toast system)
- [ ] Update all components using the custom toast system to use the chosen one
- [ ] Remove the deprecated toast implementation
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect the consolidated approach

### Phase 3: Provider Performance Optimization

- [ ] Analyze render performance of the provider hierarchy
- [ ] Consider using React.memo or useMemo for expensive operations in providers
- [ ] Review provider dependency order to minimize unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Create provider-specific testing utilities

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Always use hooks instead of directly accessing context
2. Keep the provider hierarchy as shallow as possible
3. New global state should be added as a context in the `/contexts` directory
4. Create custom hooks for all contexts in the `/hooks` directory

## Testing Plan

For each phase:
1. Test all UI flows that might be affected by provider changes
2. Verify authentication continues to work correctly
3. Ensure toast notifications appear correctly
4. Check for performance regressions

## Timeline

- Phase 1: Short-term priority
- Phase 2: Medium-term priority
- Phase 3: Long-term priority
