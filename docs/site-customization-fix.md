# Site Customization Component Fix

This document explains how we fixed the "Element type is invalid" error in the site customization page.

## Problem

The error occurred when rendering the SiteCustomizationPage component:

```
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.

Check the render method of `SiteCustomizationPage`.
```

## Causes and Solutions

### 1. Firebase Configuration Issues

The site customization page was failing because the Firebase client SDK was not properly initialized in Next.js client components.

#### Solution:

- Updated `firebase/config.ts` to properly export initialized Firebase instances
- Added better error handling and fallback values when Firebase fails to initialize
- Fixed variable naming in the exports

### 2. Component Import Issues

The error was also caused by improper imports between the server and client components.

#### Solution:

- Rewrote the site customization page to use `dynamic` imports correctly
- Added a proper loading state to display while the client component loads
- Ensured the client component is properly exported with `export default`

### 3. TypeScript and React Component Type Issues

The error can occur when TypeScript doesn't correctly recognize a React component.

#### Solution:

- Simplified the client component to reduce complexity
- Fixed component typing issues
- Added proper error boundaries and loading states

## How to Test the Fix

1. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to `/[username]/dashboard/site-customization`

3. Verify that the page loads correctly

## Preventative Measures

- Added validation scripts to test Firebase client SDK: `scripts/test-firebase-client.js`
- Used dynamic imports with `{ ssr: false }` to prevent hydration issues
- Added loading states to prevent flash of unstyled content
