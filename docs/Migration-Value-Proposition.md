Making migration easy **and** understanding our unique value proposition are critical for long-term adoption and differentiation of Minispace.dev.

## ‚úÖ **Migration Strategy: How to Support Users Migrating from Other Platforms**

These platforms generally store content in one of two ways:

1. Markdown files (e.g. Hugo, Gatsby, Jekyll)
2. Web API or hosted CMS (e.g. micro.blog)

To support easy migration, you should support **both static file import** and **API-based ingestion**.

### üß© For Markdown-Based Platforms (Hugo, Gatsby, Jekyll, BearBlog)

**Approach: Provide a Markdown Import Tool**

**Steps:**

1. **Let users upload a zip** of their content folder (`/content`, `_posts`, etc.).
2. **Parse the Markdown files** using a library like `gray-matter` to extract frontmatter + content.
3. **Transform the structure** to your internal format:

   * Convert each `.md` to a new "Post"
   * Map frontmatter like `title`, `date`, `tags` to Firebase fields
4. Store in the user‚Äôs `posts` or `pages` collection.

**Considerations:**

* Allow folder-based import (e.g. Hugo's `content/blog/*.md`)
* Support frontmatter like:

  ```yaml
  ---
  title: "My First Post"
  date: 2021-01-01
  slug: "my-first-post"
  draft: true
  ---
  ```

---

### üîå For API-Based Platforms (e.g. Micro.blog)

**Approach: Use API Tokens or Export Tools**

* Micro.blog and others often have export tools (e.g. JSON or RSS).
* Let users paste a Micro.blog export link or upload the `.json` or `.xml` file.
* Parse and transform entries into your Firebase format.
* For RSS: convert `<item><title>...</title></item>` to a `post`.

---

## üõ† Tools You Should Build

* **"Import from another platform" page**
* Drag-and-drop `.zip` or file upload
* RSS feed parser (e.g. for blogs that don't provide markdown)
* Markdown importer with preview and mapping UI

| Area                       | Minispace.dev                               | Others                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Subdomain hosting**      | username.minispace.dev (built-in)           | Custom DNS setup required               |
| **Real-time editor**       | Rich markdown WYSIWYG with live preview     | Often file-based or static preview only |

## üß≠ Your Unique Positioning

Minispace.dev can position itself as:

> ‚ÄúA no-code publishing tool for developers and creatives who want the performance of static sites without the setup complexity of Hugo or Jekyll.‚Äù

It‚Äôs the best of both worlds:

* Developer-like performance
* Non-developer ease-of-use
* Cloud-native (no local Git or build pipelines)

---

## ‚úÖ Action Plan for Supporting Migration

1. Create an ‚ÄúImport your content‚Äù section in the user dashboard.
2. Support `.zip` upload ‚Üí parse markdown or frontmatter
3. Support RSS/JSON upload ‚Üí map content fields
4. Build lightweight content transformation pipeline (file ‚Üí post object ‚Üí Firebase)
5. Offer migration guides per platform (e.g. ‚ÄúHow to export from BearBlog to Minispace‚Äù)

From the value proposition here, we need to replace the features section with a fancy deisgn to display our value proposition, maybe even use a table to display this.
